# BibTex author shortener

This is a simple Python script that shortens the authors field of your `BibTex` file.

## Usage
For help, run the command
```
	python3 bib_shorten.py --help
```

## TODO
The script breaks if the `author` field spans more than one line. Maybe try to merge lines if we see that the author field is not closed.
